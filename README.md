### About shUnit2

[shUnit2](http://code.google.com/p/shunit2/) is a xUnit for ShellScript.

Download it from [here](http://code.google.com/p/shunit2/) (I've downloaded `shunit2-2.1.6.tgz`) and extract it. Then, copy `src/shunit2` into `test` directory.

An official documentation is [here](http://shunit2.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/source/2.1/doc/shunit2.html). Refer it to know how to use shUnit2 more.
